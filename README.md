# UW-TEAM FAQ DOWNLOADER

Ruby script to quickly grab all materials from [UW-TEAM FAQ](http://www.uw-team.org/faq.html) website. This is an old polish website with info related to hacking/security.

It can save you a few clicks. Only relevant for polish-speaking ppl with high laziness level. Just run it with Ruby interpreter.

### TODO:
* refactor code a little
* add automatic unzipping to a dir
